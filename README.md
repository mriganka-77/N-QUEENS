🧠 About the N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

It's a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem and is commonly solved using backtracking algorithms.
